# Main Infrastructure

## Chapter 1: What is this?
This is the base of all infrastructure resources that will be use on my blog.
You'll need to apply resources in this folder if you want to try execute my blogs demo.

Run this command from repository root folder to create all resources:
```bash
task apply-all -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure
```
