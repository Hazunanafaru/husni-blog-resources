## Usage
1. Make sure to change `locals` section in [terragrunt.hcl](./terragrunt.hcl) with your Googe Cloud Storage Bucket.
2. Use Taskfile CLI to appy, plan, and destroy infra resources. Here is the example commands.
```bash
# List all task subcommands
task --list-all

# Plan all resources under ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure folder
task plan-all -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure
# Apply all resources under ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure folder
task apply-all -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure
# Destroy all resources under ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure folder
task destroy-all -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure

# Plan husni-blog-resources VPC resource
task plan -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure/global/vpc/husni-blog-resources
# Apply husni-blog-resources VPC resource
task apply -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure/global/vpc/husni-blog-resources
# Destroy husni-blog-resources VPC resource
task destroy -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure/global/vpc/husni-blog-resources
```
3. Create base infrastructure resources in [000-main-infrastructure](./000-main-infrastructure) folder
by execute this commmand from root repository.
```bash
task apply-all -- ./000-main-infrastructure/infrastructure/
```
